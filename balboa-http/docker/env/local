# Setting the CASSANDRA_DATACENTER will limit Cassandra connections to only
# cluster members in the specified datacenter. If there are none, it won't
# connect. However, connecting to only local cluster members significantly
# reduces the latency of Cassandra queries. If this value is not specified,
# Cassandra connections by this service may connect to any member of the
# Cassandra cluster.
