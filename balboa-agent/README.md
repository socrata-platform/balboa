# Balboa Agent

Balboa Agents are standalone processes transport metrics that were written to
disk locally to the metrics data store.

## Installation

This project is published as a maven repository and can be utilized and
referenced as such through socrata's public release library.

 SBT:
 1. Add the Socrata release repository to the project's `build.sbt`:

 ```
  resolvers := Seq(
    "socrata maven" at "https://repository-socrata-oss.forge.cloudbees.com/release"
  )
 ```

2. Add the balboa-client dependency to the project's library dependencies:

  ```
  libraryDependencies ++= Seq(
    ...
    "com.socrata" % "balboa-agent" %% "0.17.+",
    ...
  )
 ```

Others: TODO

## Usage and Code Example

### Terminology

* _agent_ : Standalone process that both consumes and emits metrics.
* _amq_ : Active MQ

### Build

Balboa Agent can built into an executable Assembly (Fat) Jar.

```
sbt balboa-agent/assembly
```

This project also incorporates [Sbt Native
Packager](http://www.scala-sbt.org/sbt-native-packager/). And builds a simple
debian package that wraps an assembly jar. This assembly jar can be found at
the debian install root /balboa-agent/bin/balboa-agent-assembly.jar.

#### Building Debian Distributions

```
sbt balboa-agent/debian:packageBin
```

This packages a debian file at
balboa-agent/target/balboa-agent_VERSION_ARCHTYPE.deb. Currently debian is
build with ARCHTYPE = all implying that it can run on all linux distros
supporting debian.

#### Building Docker Containers (In Progress)

Requirements
* docker

Completed
* End to End docker container composition with sbt-native-package, socrata/java
  base image, and socrata user

In Progress
* Configuring docker registry to support `sbt balboa-agent/docker:publish`
* Ensuring SBT-Native-Pacakager and Socrata Ship.d play nice.


Currently docker can be built and published to the local docker server via...
```
sbt balboa-agent/docker:publishLocal
```

Publish Docker to a remote docker repository
```
sbt balboa-agent/docker:publishLocal
```

Stage the docker file and related contents locally at
balboa-agent/target/docker/stage
```
sbt balboa-agent/docker:stage
```

### Configuration

Configuration is done through environmental variables. The list of
configurable variables can be found in each project's reference.conf
file. Defaults can be found in the application.conf files.

### Running out of the box

`cd balboa && sbt assembly`
`sbt balboa-agent/run "Command line arguments"`

## Tests

### Unit Tests

Standard SBT Tests.

```
sbt balboa-agent/test
```

### Integration Tests

sbt balboa-agent/run
sbt balboa-agent/it:test

* Now, the integration tests should be able to write to the file system and
  read from the queue.

## History

Balboa-agent formerly the Metric Consumer started off as a one off project to
help ingest and consolidate metrics on individual servers. This helped manage
the amount of traffic being pushed through activemq.
