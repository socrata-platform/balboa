 * Base Specification for Encoding and Decoding anything that is sent via Kafka.  In order to utilize your own KafkaCodec,

 *  "properties: VerifiableProperties = null".  This a requirement imposed by Kafka due to the use of reflection to create
 *  appropriate instances.

 * Examples: [[BalboaMessageCodec]], [[BalboaMessageCodecLike]], [[StringCodec]], and [[StringCodecLike]]
 * Reference: [[Decoder]] and [[Encoder]].
